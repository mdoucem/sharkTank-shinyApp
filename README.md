# sharkTank-shinyApp

This Shiny App helps to visualize the deals that have been made on Shark Tank.

## Right-hand side
On the right hand side, you see a scatter plot showing all the companies that have gotten deals. Currently only 3 seasons are included in the data, but more can easily be added.

- Y-axis shows the deal amount, while
- X-axis shows the equity that was given in the deal.

- Upon hovering, you get more information, including the Name of the company and the Valuation amount.
- The deals are also colored by the Industry it belongs to.

## Left-hand side
On the left-hand side, the app allows you to select:
- The maximum deal amount, whereby the app responds to show you all the deals made under that amount.
- The Season - the app then shows you only the deals made in that season.
- The Gender - the app shows you only deals where the presenters were of that selected gender.

As future work, it will be good to allow the user to make a selection and see deals made by a particular Shark on the show.
